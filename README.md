# Real_Noisy_Clean_Color_IMAGES
This is a publicly available database that contains real noisy and clean color images.

The download link is available at XXX, to get the password, please contact kong.zm@mail.scut.edu.cn

This database consists of more than 100 real noisy and clean images using different camera lens, many of them ourdoor natural scenes, since the clean images are generated by averaging over 100 noisy images for each scene, they are not strictly aligned with noisy images due to the variation of background (light, wind, cloud and moving people). 

Since the database is large, a cropped version will be provided in the future.

The database will be updated by including more camera lens and more challeging scenes.

For more questions, please contact me via kong.zm@mail.scut.edu.cn.
