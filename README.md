# Real_Noisy_Clean_Color_IMAGES
This is a publicly available database that contains real noisy and clean color images.

This database consists of more than 180 real noisy and clean images using different camera lens, many of them ourdoor natural scenes, since the clean images are generated by averaging over 100 noisy images for each scene, they are not strictly aligned with noisy images due to the variation of background (light, wind, cloud and moving people). To mimic real-world cases, we use 'auto-mode' for mobile phones, while parameter settings (ISO, aperture, shutter speed) of digital SLR cameras are manually adjusted to produce best possible visual effects. In other words, we do not intentionally produce noisy images.

The download link is available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yejcceQ9tNVjbAWagpzDxw, to get the password, please contact kong.zm@mail.scut.edu.cn. Also to download the resources, you might need to first install Baidu Netdisk (available at https://pan.baidu.com/download).

Since the database is large, a cropped version containing about 200 images is also available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fDBWyxyfG27dwlpRPqhc5Q, the cropped images are carefully chosen so that there do not exist clear misalignment. Also, the cropped images are divided into two separate parts: indoor scenes and outdoor scenes. We think that the outdoor scenes may better reflect the real needs, because the lighting condition can not be manually controlled.

The database will be updated by including more camera lens and daily scenes.
