# Real_Noisy_Clean_Color_IMAGES
This is a publicly available database that contains real noisy and clean color images.

This database consists of more than 100 real noisy and clean images using different camera lens, many of them ourdoor natural scenes, since the clean images are generated by averaging over 100 noisy images for each scene, they are not strictly aligned with noisy images due to the variation of background (light, wind, cloud and moving people). A more detailed description of it will be published in the future.

The download link is available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yejcceQ9tNVjbAWagpzDxw, to get the password, please contact kong.zm@mail.scut.edu.cn. Also to download the resources, you might need to first install Baidu Netdisk (available at https://pan.baidu.com/download).

Since the database is large, a cropped version containing about 200 images is also available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fDBWyxyfG27dwlpRPqhc5Q, the cropped images are carefully chosen so that there does not exist clear misalignment.

The database will be updated by including more camera lens and daily scenes.

If you find this resource useful, please kindly include the link in your paper.
